You will see a trend in HTML that <example> is used to mark the beginning of a
section that is specified by the keyword used within the <>
EX: <head>

To mark the end of a section, you typically use the same notation as to mark the
beginning of the section with the inclusion of a / sign 
EX: </head>

Every HTML file you will make must begin with:
<!DOCTYPE html>
This indicates that what you are making is an HTML file.

After that, you want to indicate the beginning and ending of your html file with:
<html>

...your stuff...

</html>

Now you will put all your work between those html notations. 
Some keywords that you will use are :
<head> - marks the header of your web page
<title> - marks the title of the web page (url)
<body> - marks the container for all visible contents on the page itself 
(headers, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, etc)
<h1> - defines a large heading
<p> - defines a paragraph
