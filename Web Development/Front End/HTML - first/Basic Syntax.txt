In HTML you will see the general trend of a section being defined by a 
start tag (marks the beginning), some content, and then an end tag (marks the ending).

These are called elements and generally look like something like this:
  <tagname> Content </tagname> 
Note that the end tag is the same keyword as the start tag with the only distinction
being the / sign

Now to get started in making your HTML file.
Every HTML file you will make MUST begin with:
<!DOCTYPE html>
This indicates that what you are making is an HTML file.
This element does not need to define an end tag

After that, you want to indicate the beginning and ending of your html file with:
<html>

...your stuff...

</html>


Now you will put all your content between those html notations. The content
itself will also be defined with their own tags. The end result will be
elements nested within other elements. The tags you will be using are: 

  <head> - marks the header of your web page
  <title> - marks the title of the web page (url)
  <body> - marks the container for all visible contents on the page itself 
    (headers, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, etc)
  <h1> - defines a large heading, there are further variations of this labeled one
    through six. One being the biggest heading and 6 being the smallest heading.

  <p> - defines a paragraph, essentially lines of text, keep in mind any formatting
    done to its text such as spaces and going down a line is ignored 
  <pre> - defines a paragraph but does reflect the formatting done to its text 
    such as spaces and going down one line.

  <br> - for line breaks (going down one line), does not require an ending tag
  <hr> - creates horizontal lines in its place, does not require an ending tag

The following keywords also often use additional attributes to provide additional
information for HTML to use. They are always encapsulated between the <> and
after the keyword used to mark the beginning of a section. The values you assign
to these attributes should always be surrounded by quotes.
  <a> - defines a hyperlink like below:
    <a href = "https://insertlinkhere.com/">text that will be hyperlink</a>
    href is attribute to define the link itself
  <img> - defines images
    <img src="yourimage.jpg" alt="yoursite.com" width="104" height="142">
