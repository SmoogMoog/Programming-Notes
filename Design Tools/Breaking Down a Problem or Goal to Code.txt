My goal with this is to note my workflow when it comes to programming a solution 
to a problem or toward a goal. I wanted this process to not only to have better
documentation of my work, but also as a means of clearly explaining to people 
who are not familiar with programming what my program does. 

Here is my general approach when wanting to code up a solution to a problem
or with the express of achieving a goal.

Keep in mind that the knowledge of coding languages comes in as being a toolbox
on what actions you can take to build a bridge between the beginning of a process
to the end.

SO now keeping this in mind here's the low-down:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Determine the input and output and their respective data types. 
This will give you your starting point and ending point before doing anything else.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2. Understand the problem.

You will hear this statement everywhere from everyone, but the complexity of this step 
is understated by the simplicity of this statement. "OF COURSE you need to understand 
the problem before you can solve it, I wasn't born yesterday", I hear you say. Believe
me when I say that this step is the most important one of them all.

To understand the problem means to understand what inputs need to be handled,
what steps need to be taken to get to an output, and what outputs will be produced.

You should model various inputs and the steps that your program will do to create
their outputs. Do this through drawings, writing steps down in english, anyway you
see fit. Make note of any common patterns you see across all the sets of steps
you write for various inputs. 

Once you gain an understanding of the problem, the answer should become clear, but
what if you are still stuck? 
Then the following tactics should prove to be effective, as they are what personally 
helps me get unstuck on problems. 

TACTICS TO GET UNSTUCK ON UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF PRIORITY: 
A. Reword the problem into your own words. Doing this alone will prompt deeper thinking
and questions about aspects of the problem that will help gain a more defined
vision.

B. Create a simpler version of the current problem and try to solve that.
You can even use this in tandem with the previous step and focus on how to do
specific parts of your rewording of the problem.
This lets you break up the problem by excluding the more complicated parts.
Once you solve the simpler version, you can pinpoint differences between the simpler
and original versions. Then you can use your solution for the simpler version and 
modify it to handle the original problem. 

C. Think of the simplest possible inputs that the problem can take
in, and what are the steps that lead to its output? 
This allows you to think of the simplest steps needed to solve the problem, and 
lets you work your way up to more complex inputs. This also has an added benefit 
of catching edge cases early.



I often use these two approaches as a starting point for problem solving. Keep in mind
these are not mutually exclusive, you can choose to use only one, or you can even
choose to use both.

SideNote: Modeling all your inputs and respective outputs now also allows you 
to write Unit Tests (Test Driven Development) later. 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3. Code the solution
With the previous step done, this step should be trivial, as it is just coding all
the common steps you have modeled. Use your knowledge of your programming language
to put your plan into action. 

You the previous tactics should at least allow you to arrive at a brute force solution


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  4. Use your knowledge of time complexities and space complexities to guide any
refactoring. 

Look at your current solution and identify its time complexity and space complexity 
among this scale:
O(1)
O(logn) - binary search
O(n) - single for loop - hashtables- two pointers - sliding window 
O(n logn) sorting
O(n^2) double for loop
O(2^n)

Is there any room for improvement in your solution? Is it possible to reach a better
solution using an algorithm or external data structure? 

You will have to identify this and make any improvements possible using your current
solution as a base. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Addendum: These new steps were formulated by me through trials and tribulation of
grinding away questions on sites such as LeetCode. I realize now that my previous 
explanation was trying to include too many topics outside of what was really 
necessary.
In short, my emphasizing UML Diagrams and other Objected Oriented Topics detracted
from the fundementals of problem solving. Those other topics and modeling methods
are important too, but should come later after you are able to form a basic 
solution so that the solution is improved in its ability to be understood.
The only exception being TDD (Test Driven Development) and Unit Tests, as 
that methodology is useful even in the early stages of problem solving.
