# Programming-Notes by Felipe Flores 
 These are my notes that I create for others and myself. The purpose of sharing these notes 
is to teach others who may struggle with the concepts included in this repository.

This also simultaneously serves my second purpose of 
desiring to truly know these topics as well as possible.
In my opinion, the best way you can learn a topic is by teaching it to someone.
Thus, I am using these notes to teach others.
 
All code examples found are done 
in C#, and are interchangable with Java.

Have fun seeing the topics I have covered!
