# Programming-Notes by Felipe Flores (Online alias: SmoogMoog) 
 These are my notes that I create for myself. The purpose of sharing these notes 
is to teach others who may struggle with the concepts included in this repository.

This serves my more selfish reason to fufill my desire of knowing the in and outs
of these topics as well as possible.
In my opinion, the best way you can learn a topic is by teaching it to someone
who is not an expert at them.

As a result, I created these notes as if I were to get amnesia one day and have to 
catch myself up on all that I have forgotten.

Have fun seeing the topics I have covered!
