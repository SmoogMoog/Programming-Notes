Class Diagrams are used to model your classes within your code and how 
these classes communicate with each other. 

Each model of a class is going to be made up of 3 different things
1. It's name at the top

2. The variables that it will contain (this could also include other Classes as 
well). 
You must specify whether the variable is PUBLIC OR PRIVATE (with plus
sign or minus sign respectively), the TYPE of variable that it is, and the name
of the variable itself.

3. The methods that it will contain (this includes constructors as well). 
You must specify whether the method is PUBLIC OR PRIVATE (with plus sign or
minus sign respectively), the name of the method, the RETURN TYPE, and 
the PARAMETER TYPE 

Now to model the relationships in between classes we have several options:
The main 3 are Inheritance, Composition/Aggregation, and Dependency/Association.
