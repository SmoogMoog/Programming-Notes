When it comes to UML Diagrams there are 2 types that you will need to use.
Static and Behaviorial. 

Static is the concrete part of the program that does not change
(hence static), namely the way that the classes are coded. 
This is a nice way to see how your code will be structured with all its 
Composition and Inheritance needs. 

Under this house we have Class Diagrams and Activity Diagrams. 


Behavioral is the part of the program that changes over time, namely
what occurs and can possibly occur during runtime. 
This is a nice way to see how your objects change during runtime in response to
"actors" (people who give input). 

Under this house we have Use Case Diagrams and Sequence Diagrams.


IMP NOTES: The three Most important Diagrams are the Use Case Diagram, Sequence 
Diagram, and Class Diagrams
IN GENERAL, you use these diagrams in the following order to model and code a
project 
Use Case Description + Use Case Diagram : WHAT it does - classes & methods
Sequence Diagram : WHEN it does the processes - sequence of methods
Class Diagram : WHAT the classes look like - code of classes 
Activity Diagram : HOW the execution does it - code of methods
