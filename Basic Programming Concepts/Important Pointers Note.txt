When a pointer points at another pointer, what happens is that they point at the 
same object in space. 

The second pointer in the chain does NOT point to wherever the second pointer
is pointing to.
EX:
Let's say we have two object, a and b
a = 5;
b = a;

a ----> 5
b ----> 6

a = b;

Now a is pointing at the same object that b is pointing to.
As a result, any changes to b will also result in a change to a beccause
they are pointing at the same thing.

IMPORTANT NOTE: In this example, keep in mind that
in this example you can now change the b pointer (second pointer) to 
point at something else while the a pointer (first pointer)
remains pointing at the original object.
