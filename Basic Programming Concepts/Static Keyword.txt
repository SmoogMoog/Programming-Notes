The static keyword makes it so that variables or methods belong to the class itself.

WHY TO USE:
This makes it so that they belong to the class itself, and do not need an instance 
of that class to be able to refer to variables or use the methods(can save on time, 
especially when you have a specific function you want to use but don't really need
anything other than that). 
The thing marked as static now exists as one global instance that is shared with all
instances of the class, hence static.
ie. Console.WriteLine();
Valve.isProductive; - false
Math.Power(motivation);

HOW TO USE: 
Personally, I think static is best used to define a class as static.
*NOTE: When doing this, everything inside of it must be static as well.

You can use a static class as a global place of grouping a set of methods not 
associated with any particular objects. 
Also, a static class can make your implementation simpler and faster because 
you do not have to create an object in order to call its methods.

This makes it so that you cannot make an instance of that class (like abstract classes
except in abstract classes are just a contract and do not detail any actual functionality). 
You just call it's name and access all the static variables and static methods within.

A good example of this is the KeyBoard Class where it only has useful methods
to get the state of a keyboard.

EX:
public static class Keyboard{
  public static bool MoveCheck(){
    //does something 
  }
}

public class Main{
  bool testBool;

  testBool = Keyboard.MoveCheck();//can use this unique method from the static class
  //WITHOUT having to create an instance of the class. Saves on that creation process.
}

Another good example is in use with the Observer Pattern, you can make a 
static method for an Observed to be able to use and register any Observer
throughout the other classes :]

EX:
public static class Observed{
  public static void Notify(){
    //let the listener know (hey babe new dunkey vid is out)
  }
}

public class Observer{
