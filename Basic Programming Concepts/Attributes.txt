Attributes seem to be a C# exclusive, but other languages seem to have their own
version of this C# feature (ex: in Java it is called "Annotations").

The official description of this feature is that Attributes "add metadata 
to different parts of your code". 
In laymens terms, Attributes are used to 
place different labels on specified parts of your code. These labels function as
indicators to the compiler that it should treat the labeled code in various ways
depending on WHICH indicator is used.

WHY TO USE: This has a variety of implications, such as labeling code to be 
exempt in certain scenarios. However, the most immediate use for this I see
is to label classes and methods as Tests for the purpose of Unit Testing
the functionality of the classes and methods in some other code.

The compiler will see the labels and run the test accordingly, complete
with input, expected output, and whether or not the test has passed.

HOW TO USE: 

[TestClass]
public class ClassForTesting{

  [TestMethod]
  public void MethodForTesting(){
    //initialize other class to use other methods, and craft the input it will all
    //use.
    //Use Assert to compare the CONCEIVED result to the EXPECTED result in relation
    //to your crafted input
  }

}

The compiler will run this and give you feedback on whether or not your test is
successful as well as giving you useful information like how fast did 
the code run, etc.
