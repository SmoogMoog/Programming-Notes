Structs are very similar to classes, but they are counted as value types 
unlike classes which are reference types.
This is they're main selling point.

Because they are counted as value types, structs are best used to form collections
of important values to be used in defining a simple data strucure WITHOUT any 
complex behaviors. 
HOW TO USE:

*NOTE FOR CONSTRUCTORS OF STRUCTS
Keep in mind you cannot create your own parameterless constructor 
and cannot benefit from inheritance. 
One parameterless constructor is supplied automatically and cannot
be changed. 

You CAN provide a constructor WITH parameters, and this is best used to 
initialize all the values that the struct will house. 
Providing a constructor to initialize the variables of a struct is in fact
the ONLY way to initialize the variables of a struct. (field or property
initializers are a no go).
 
You make them the same way you make a class, where the class keyword is 
replaced with the struct keyword.

public struct Vector2D{
  int x;
  int y;

  public Vector2D(int x, int y){
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }

}
