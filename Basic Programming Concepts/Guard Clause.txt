A technique used to increase readibility of code by reducing the need for 
nesting if statements within each other.

This is achieved by having multiple exit points within a method (ie multiple
return statements). One of these exit points is executed when an if condition 
is passed as true, in which case further checks are skipped.

These if conditions can be seen as guards or filters, where they decide as to
whether or not the input is a valid criteria.

This reduces splitting paths within code and makes it more "flat".

Ex: 

public bool dataMatch(Node inputNode, int desiredVal){

  if(input != null){

    if(inputNode.data == desiredVal){
      return true;
    }
    else{
      return false;
    }
  }

  else{
    return false;
  }

}

VS.

public bool dataMarch(Node inputNode, int desiredVal){
  if(input == null){
    return false;
  }

  if(inputNode.data != desiredVal){
    return false;
  }

  return true;
}
This is much easier to read and follow than a bunch of nesting.
