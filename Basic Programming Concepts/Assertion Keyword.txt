Assertions (or assert) are a way to tell your program to check if a value is equal
to another value that you specify. Many programming languages come with this
feature, but the exact keyword may vary.

WHY TO USE:
Assertions are another debugging tool, in which they allow you to catch errors
in your code at runtime.

They allow you to "make sure" or "assert" that a value should equal to 
another value AT THAT MOMENT in your program. This is extrememly useful for
catching logical errors early so that you know your code is on the right track.

As a result, assertions (in my opinion) mainly useful for performing Unit Tests
on your code (see Testing folder for more detail). I personally mostly use 
assertions within and for Unit Tests.
