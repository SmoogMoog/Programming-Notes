Best Case: O(N logn) Worst Case: O(N^2) depends on luck of pivot. 
You want the pivot to be the most center VALUE possible. 

Select an item in the array to be the pivot
Partition the array so that all items less than the pivot are to the left of the pivot,  
and all the items greater than the pivot are to the right


Repeat the previous process on the left half
Repeat the previous process of the right half

Do this until each element of the array is by itself. 

Quick sort is "on the way down" sorting.
