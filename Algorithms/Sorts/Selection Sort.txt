O(N^2)
Almost never used.

Find the minimum item in the unsorted  part of the array

Swap it with the first item in the unsorted  part of the array

Repeat steps 1 and 2 to sort the remainder  of the array

ANALOGY: Think of the scenario where we are sorting an hand of cards
We look through all the cards and find the smallest number first, 
then we swap that minimum number with the first part of the array 
than is still unsorted. 

Do this for the remainder of the array.
