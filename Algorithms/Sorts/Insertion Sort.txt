Best Case: O(N) Worst Case: O(N^2)
Good for small N

There are 2 major sections in this algorithm.
Sorted Portion and Unsorted Portion.

You always start by taking in the first element of the array
into the sorted portion, the rest is considered unsorted.

Then you go take the first element of the unsorted portion
and compare that with the element in the sorted portion,
placing it in the correct spot. 
As the sorted portion grows, you will have to go down the sorted 
portion elements doing a check each time if the new item your are 
introducing from the unsorted portion is less than the element you are 
comparing it in the sorted portion. 

QUICK:
The first array item is the sorted portion of the array
Take the second item and insert it in the sorted portion

Repeat steps 1 and 2 to sort the remainder of the array
