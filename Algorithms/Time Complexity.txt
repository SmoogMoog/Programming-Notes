Not all computers have the same performance.
Computer Specs, Memory, Disk Space, Other processes running, etc.

So in order to be able to measure performance time in a consist manner across all these
other factors.

So we use Complexity: A measure of the computing resources that are used by a piece of code.

We represent it in Big-O notation. Ex: quadratic algorithm O(N^2) or O(N logn)
