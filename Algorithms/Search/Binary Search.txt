Divides what you have to search by half! O(log N)

Compare what you want with the element located in the middle
of the array. 

If you found it, great!

If not check the top half of the array or the bottom
half of the array depending if the value you are trying to locate is > the middle
 or < the middle. (go to top half or bottom half respectively). 

Repeat till you found it. 

*This only works if the array is previously sorted!
