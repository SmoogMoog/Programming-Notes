As the name suggests, "Unit Tests" test a small chunk of code with NO external 
dependencies. If external dependencies are needed to test, then you create mockups
of those dependencies when testing. 

The reasons for Unit Testing are two-fold. First, Unit Tests encourages good
practice in keeping your code modular ie. each individual part must do one
thing ONLY. (Do not make any monoliths where a single class takes care of 
every job).

The second is that Unit Tests allow you to save you time by being able to show you
whether or not your code works instantly (as opposed to manually running it and 
looking at the results).
