Using Unit Tests in Microsoft Visual Studio partially stems from the type of
.Net you decide to implement. 

.Net is Microsofts solution to make software development of varying types 
easier for individuals. This includes Desktop Apps, Web Apps, Video Games Dev (Unity),
and Mobile apps. You can generally choose any language you want, but the one that 
is best supported first and foremost is C#.

There are 4 main players in the .Net family: 
.NET Framework, .NET Core, .NET , and .NET Standard.
Framework is the oldest, and is no longer getting updated, but is still supported.
.NET Core goes up to a few versions, and is newer. 
.NET is the continuation of .NET Core but with a different name
.NET Standard seems to be temporary, but works across all .NETs. 

I myself am still a little confused, but they all make developing things easier.
