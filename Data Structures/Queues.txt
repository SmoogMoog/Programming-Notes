Analogy: Think of a line of people waiting to checkout at a cashier.

(Peek, Enqueue, Dequeue)
All these operations have a performance of O(1)

FIRST IN FIRST OUT (FIFO)

To traverse a queue, the temp pointers keep track of the front of the queue
and the back of the queue. Because of this you may want to call these pointers
as front and back respectively. 

WHEN TO USE: The key to know is if the ORDER of data is important.
Whenever you want to pay special priority to a thing that has occured
FIRST (think of a person who came in first to a waiting room for a doctor), 
use a queue. You wouldn't choose to first take care of a person who arrived to 
the waiting room later, would you?

If you have a scenario where you do not care about the ORDER in which data comes in,
then look elsewhere.

HOW TO USE:
EX: 
public class Queue{
  Node front;
  Node back; 

  public Queue{
    front = null;
    back = null;
  }

  public void Enqueue(int d){
    //....
  }

  public void Dequeue(){
    //....
  }

}
