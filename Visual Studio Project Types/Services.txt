Services seem to be console applications that you do not have to run manually
Sometimes they can be run on a schedule, other times it seems like they will even run
while the device is turned off? 

There is windows schedule tasker, but using a windows service seems to be overall more
reliable

It also seems that console apps can be made to be a service and visa versa,
The caviat with services in that they do not have a console window, so you cannot
ReadLine nor print anything out to console. 

Services seems to be for automating tasks in which the input does not come directly
from user interaction.

In visual studio, services run a lot like console applications, with a gui.
However when we install it and run it in the background (as services are meant to do
) we will not see that at all since it runs in the background. If you want a GUI
then you create a traditional application.
